## History

UlibCpp (or then called "ulib") started as a folder with include files that I
often use in projects. At some time I decided to create a static library as
well as a DLL that contains the classes that were not header-only. Versions 1
and 2 were compiled under Win32 and also for the Windows Mobile platform, as I
wrote command line and WTL apps for those platforms.

Versions 1 and 2 had many more classes that were only used in one project. In
version 3 I started a new solution and project and tried to keep the classes
at the lowest common denominator. Also the Windows Mobile platform wasn't as
relevant now. I kept (and copied) the ulib files in several repositories where
they tended to drift apert.

When discovering that NuGet also works for C++ libraries, I decided to do a
new version of ulib, this time named UlibCpp, to differentiate from all the
C# NuGet packages. Over time I added some more classes and methods from the
various projects I'm publicly developing on GitHub.

Currently the following projects of mine use UlibCpp:
- [winLAME](https://github.com/vividos/winLAME)
- [RemotePhotoTool](https://github.com/vividos/RemotePhotoTool)
- Some projects in the [OldStuff](https://github.com/vividos/OldStuff) repository
